Floppy Bird PWA (Progressive Web Application)
This version of Floppy Bird basically acts like a basic app for your smartphone or computer without having to actually be one. If you want to install it as one.

It works the same as the other version for Floppy-Bird, where it's mobile friednly and it can run in your browser, but you can choose to install it like as if it were a real app.

Play the game in your browser:

Now since I suck at my own game, This is the score system! (In-game footage)

Instead of researching how to make computer AI into scary machines that can take over the world. It sits back and helps us make amazingly well crafted games like Floppy Bird!

For whatever reason I couldn't call my repo, "Floppy-Bird-PWA" Otherwise it wouldn't properly apply the changes I made to the javascript into the actuall page that was being hosted on Github. So I decided to call it, "Floppy-Web-App" Because it was close enough.
